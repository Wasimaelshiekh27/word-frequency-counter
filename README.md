# Word Frequency Counter

This project is a multithreaded C++ application that counts the frequency of words in a text file. Each segment of the file is processed by a separate thread, allowing for efficient and concurrent word counting.

## Features

- Multithreaded processing of text files
- Accurate word frequency counting
- Easy to use command-line interface
